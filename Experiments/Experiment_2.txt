Me:> Make a Car Rental System using following entities - CarRentalSystem, Car, Rental and Customer. Use PlantUML format.

ChatGPT:> Sure, here's an example Car Rental System using PlantUML format:

@startuml
class CarRentalSystem {
    +searchAvailableCars(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): List<Car>
    +rentCar(car: Car, customer: Customer, startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Rental
    +returnCar(rental: Rental, endDate: Date): void
}

class Car {
    -id: int
    -make: String
    -model: String
    -year: int
    -color: String
    -status: RentalStatus
}

class Rental {
    -id: int
    -car: Car
    -customer: Customer
    -startDate: Date
    -endDate: Date
}

class Customer {
    -id: int
    -name: String
    -address: String
    -phoneNumber: String
}

enum RentalStatus {
    AVAILABLE
    RENTED
}

CarRentalSystem -> Car
CarRentalSystem -> Rental
CarRentalSystem -> Customer
Car -> Rental
Rental -> Customer
Car --> RentalStatus

In this system, CarRentalSystem is the main entity, which contains methods for searching available cars, renting a car, and returning a car. 
Car represents a specific car in the system, which has an ID, make, model, year, color, and rental status. 
Rental represents a rental agreement between a customer and a car, which has an ID, a car, a customer, a start date, and an end date. 
Customer represents a customer in the system, which has an ID, a name, an address, and a phone number. 
RentalStatus is an enum that represents the rental status of a car, which can be either available or rented.
The diagram shows the relationships between the entities, such as how CarRentalSystem interacts with Car, Rental, and Customer, and how Car and Rental are related.
